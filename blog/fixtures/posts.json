    "body": "This is one of the fastest ways to learn online marketing.\r\nI did this myself for three years. The experience I gained sped up the learning curves of website building, social media management, Facebook advertising, SEO, and email marketing... just to name a few. I also developed many other skills necessary for our current online business.\r\n\r\nYou can effectively become a quality control coach outsourcing all of these projects to freelancers on Upwork, Onlinejobs.ph, Fiverr, and many other freelance websites. If you\u2019d like additional information and insight on digital marketing arbitrage, check out my video explaining the ins and outs.\r\n\r\nThe really cool thing about outsourcing these virtual jobs to, say, the Philippines or India, is that you can spend your time during the day meeting up with clients. And then, by the evening, you can send out your assignments to your virtual team. Because of the time differences, they can work on those assignments overnight, so you\u2019re able to get twice as much work done with this online business model.\r\n\r\nTo make money with this model, find businesses that need digital marketing services, social media help, blogs, or graphic design. You then sell them the contract, outsource the job to freelancers for less, and coach them to produce a quality product for your client.\r\n\r\nTo build your reputation and prove you can follow through with what you say, you can initially offer your services for free or at a deep discount, to make sure that you can pull off what you say you can do and begin to build that credibility.\r\n\r\nMost of these virtual assistants are outside of the US; at least the ones you can pay and still turn a profit. Effective communication with someone outside of the US requires a different art form and a lot of attention to quality control. You can\u2019t merely say \"make a logo look like this,\" and email it to me in two days, then deliver it to your client.",

Can you crush it at video editing?\r\n\r\nFor this type of business, you need to play to your strengths and do what you are good at.\r\n\r\nYou should also strive to choose a niche that you love.\r\n\r\nFinding work as a freelancer, at that point, is mostly about finding other businesses (including ecommerce store businesses) that want to pass off some of their workload to someone else.\r\n\r\nThis could be digital businesses, a local company, brick-and-mortar businesses, ecommerce stores, business owners\u2026 your clients could really be anyone who is already making money, who is looking to scale, and needs skilled help to make that happen.\r\n\r\nYou could step in and fill a role for these types of clients as a freelancer\u2026 and this would get you out of that 9-to-5 job grind, where you could get some flexibility and open up your opportunities a little bit more.\r\n\r\nYou could then leverage that to go on and start your own digital marketing agency, or work on building up another side-hustle or passive income business of your own.",

    "slug": "saas-software-service",
    "author": 1,
    "body": "Want to solve people\u2019s biggest problems with software, or become a software developer and build tools to help your clients? Well if you do, then software as a service could be the perfect home based business opportunity for you!\r\n\r\nPeople would gladly pay for, subscribe to, and use software that proves to be relevant to their needs.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how you can turn SaaS into your online home business:\r\n\r\nFirst, design and create a program or software product that would help your clients. You can either create a program or software product yourself, or you can outsource the build to an app developer. You can then begin to sell your product and offer subscriptions for recurring cash inflow.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re the type who geeks out on software design and development, then this online business model is right up your alley. Can you think of an enormous problem people face, and come up with a software solution that solves their problem? If so, then people will gladly pay for your product.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true if they can\u2019t find the solution anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe SaaS Market just keeps getting BIGGER.\r\n\r\n33% of companies use more SaaS applications, with 16 apps/ company\r\n38% of US businesses adopted a SaaS-exclusive workplace in 2017, with a measly 17% doing the same thing in 2016\r\nThe expected growth of the SaaS market by 2020 is $76 billion\r\n80% of end users in the US prefer SaaS and cloud-hosted apps for organization and communication, with only 51% on-board in 2016\r\nDid you know 4 BIG Tech companies, such as Microsoft, CA Technologies, SAP, and IBM, have all made the switch to SaaS product development? As you can see, software as a service is a very profitable online business.\r\n\r\nPlus, certain software solutions are responsible for boosting the SaaS market share with collaboration applications, ERP, CRM, business intelligence, and HR management.\r\n\r\nThe development and need for SaaS are rapidly increasing and evolving. As the demand continues to soar, it\u2019s time to get creative and come up with software to solve people\u2019s problems.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like your cup of tea, you can base your online business on SaaS and become privy to incredible earning potential.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP), the future of SaaS will incorporate an AI layer for better interaction between the user and the software. This layer also promotes deeper learning opportunities in business analytics.\r\n\r\nNot really techy? Not a problem. You can outsource the software build to freelancers or software companies, then market your SaaS product to customers and clients. You can even offer your product for subscription fees on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. As people keep on subscribing, your cash inflow will just keep coming.\r\n\r\nThe trick in launching a SAAS fast and cheap is to follow the Lean Startup Method, and launch a Minimum Viable Funnel before you spend all the time creating the product. You never know if what you will create will sell, so test selling it before you make it with an MVF.",

    "body": "Crocheting, knitting, making jewelry\u2026 there are so many handmade goods out there, and unfortunately\u2026 people often overlook this one because it isn\u2019t one of the \u2018fancier\u2019 online options.\r\n\r\nBut it is absolutely viable, and there is a huge market for it.\r\n\r\nThere is especially a market for these types of goods when they are marketed with your own personal story.\r\n\r\nFor example\u2026 let\u2019s say that your baby has sensitive skin, and can\u2019t use regular sunscreen.\r\n\r\nMaybe he/she breaks out in a rash if they do, because their skin is just extremely, extremely sensitive.\r\n\r\nWell, if you can come up with a sunscreen that actually works\u2026 that\u2019s not only nontoxic, but that is also safe for your baby\u2019s skin, free of harsh chemicals, and made with only natural ingredients\u2026 that\u2019s a big thing!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a real, viable product!\r\n\r\nAnd the fact that you can market it using a real-life story is also really powerful.\r\n\r\nStory Powered Marketing is a real thing. And having a story to tell customers why your product is awesome is a very effective way to market it and win buyers over.\r\n\r\nWhere To Sell Homemade Goods\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nYes, this list is of the top online businesses\u2026 but honestly, a lot of people also overlook local outlets.\r\n\r\nFarmer\u2019s markets, for example, are awesome for entrepreneurs who are also creators. This can be a great outlet to get real world feedback on what you are creating before you start selling it online.\r\n\r\nYou can get people to try it, you can ask for their opinion, you can improve on it, you can solve problems and answer questions\u2026 this very intimate level of community interaction can teach you a lot about not only the process of creating your product, but also the process of marketing that product to your target customers.\r\n\r\nWhat Types Of Items Can You Make?",

You keep releasing content, you keep publishing, you keep learning, and you keep delving deeper and deeper into that subject.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s when you will start to become an authority on the subject.\r\n\r\nOnce this happens, and once you start to gain more followers, you will start to find opportunities for monetization.\r\n\r\nAds are one possibility, but there are certainly more options than this.\r\n\r\nYou could get sponsors\u2026 you could get brand deals\u2026 you could start developing and releasing your own electronic products, and marketing them to your followers.\r\n\r\nYou could leverage your audience to start an email list, and then market to that list as you release new products, memberships, courses, e-books, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of ways to monetize this.

There are even those who choose to do it full-time and ditch their day jobs altogether!\r\n\r\nI mean, if the income is double, triple, or maybe even 10x their previous paycheck, what\u2019s holding them back from diving in entirely, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n>  I\u2019ve always been more interested\r\n>  in the future than in the past.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing an internet or lifestyle business to start, you want to make sure it hits these three points:\r\n\r\nProvides the freedom to live anywhere you want\r\nAllows a flexible work schedule\r\nAchieves high-income opportunities\r\nIt\u2019s almost like semi-retiring early, except you don\u2019t have to wait until you\u2019re old and gray.
